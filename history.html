                <p class="p-1 text-justify " > The first Travel Agency of the world was established by Thomas Cook in 1845 in England.

        <p class="p-4 text-justify ">  the future of the travel industry will depend on more than just travelers’ pent-up demand. For some, the romance that travel used to inspire was already wearing thin even before the crisis. We spoke to people across multiple geographies who have traveled in the last two months,5 and the one constant across their experiences was added stress—whether due to limited entry points, multiple new checkpoints, or fellow travelers’ inconsistent compliance with published safety measures..[7]</p>
