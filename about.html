        <h3> &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Who we are</h3>
        <p class="p-4 text-justify">
            A travel agency is a private retailer or public service that provides travel and tourism-related services to the general public on behalf of accommodation or travel suppliers to offer different kinds of travelling packages for each destination..2

            Travel agents help their clients make travel plans. In addition to booking reservations, they assist customers in choosing their destination, transportation, and lodging and inform travellers of passport and visa requirements, rates of currency exchange, and import duties..3

        <h3> &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Mission </h3>
        <p class="p-4 text-justify">
            As a travel company, we exist to bring people together. When people come together, they create opportunities for shared experience, dialogue, and growth.

Around the world, civil protests against ongoing social injustices continue to highlight the stark inequalities that prevent some people from being empowered participants in these opportunities.

As a company, we’ve traditionally stayed out of public debate on social issues; our focus has been on the work of providing a safe, respectful and inclusive work environment for all our people. However, in an atmosphere of heightened awareness and involvement, we believe it’s important to add our voices to the discussion and share our perspective with you..3
